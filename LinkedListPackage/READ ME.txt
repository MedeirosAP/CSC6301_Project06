Java program designed to accept user input values and store them in a sorted linked list. 


Documents and directories:

Class Diagram is found in the PDF file in the parent directory 'LinkedListPackage'. 

Documentation is included in the directory 'LinkedListPackage/docs'. 

Java source code files located in directory 'LinkedListPackage/src'.

Compiled java code located in directory 'LinkedListPackage/build'.


Commands for operation:

	Documentation Command:
	Navigate to directory 'LinkedListPackage', use command: javadoc -d docs src/*.java

	Program Operation Command:
	Navigate to the 'LinkedListPackage/src' source directory using the command: cd .../LinkedListPackage/src

	The Main is run to execute the program, use the command: java main.java


The Main will run, and prompt the user for an integer value. The user may enter an integer, or 'exit' to stop the program.

The program will recieve the integer values and insert them into the linked list sorted in order, then print the list. 

When the program ends the final list will be printed. 


Code Reuse:

In the program, an example of code reuse is the use of the SortedLinkedList class by both the Main class and the InputHandler class.
The SortedLinkedList class encapsulates the logic for maintaining a sorted list, and this functionality is utilized by the InputHandler class to insert user inputs in order and by the Main class to display the final sorted list.

Encapsulation of Sorting Logic:

The SortedLinkedList class encapsulates the logic for inserting elements in a sorted manner.
This logic is reusable and can be used by any other class that needs to maintain a sorted list.

Using SortedLinkedList in InputHandler:

The InputHandler class uses the SortedLinkedList class to insert user inputs while maintaining the sorted order.
This shows reuse of the sorting logic provided by the SortedLinkedList class.

Displaying the Sorted List in Main:

The Main class uses the SortedLinkedList class to display the final sorted list.
This shows reuse of the data structure and its toString method to get a string representation of the sorted list.
